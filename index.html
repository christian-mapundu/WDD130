        <p>Hello, my name is Christian Tawanda Mapundu and I am from Zimbabwe, Mutare. I enjoy watching movies and learning. I am 24 years old and i am not married yet. I am currently enrolled at Byu-Idaho through pathway connect. I am pursuing my first certificate in web and computer programming. I am enjoying the process. Help continues along the way. Eveything imparted through this sacred experience is a treasure to me. learning Web fundamentals is a joy because I can see the endless possibilities that it brings. My mind has began to learn a completely new language and I am beginning to see language as a fascinating thing which thing I had scacely understood. I continue to learn dispite the rather challenging obstacles that I face on a daily basis. "The future is bright as your faith", A prophet said. As time is passing my faith in the usefulness of this language is growing, surely if language written dawn can display such wonderful and complex imaginations what more evidence can i need to believe and hail the reality of a greater being, yea even a greater intelligence. </p>
